# Cloud Storage in Action

A Spring Boot REST API for image management that currently uses local file system storage. The goal of this project is to migrate it to use a **cloud object storage** service, transforming it into a cloud-enabled application.

## About

This project is part of the **Enterprise Cloud Application (ECA)** module in the **Higher Diploma in Software Engineering (HDSE)** program at the **Institute of Software Engineering (IJSE)**. It is intended exclusively for students enrolled in this program.

## Objective

As it stands, this application stores all uploaded images on the local machine (`~/.ijse/eca/storage`). Your task is to **clone this repository** and migrate the storage layer so that it uses a cloud object storage provider (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage), making the application fully cloud-enabled.

## Tech Stack

- Java 25
- Spring Boot 4.0.2
- Maven
- Lombok
- Public Cloud Storage

## API Endpoints

| Method   | Endpoint                  | Description              |
|----------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| `POST`   | `/api/v1/images`          | Upload an image          |
| `GET`    | `/api/v1/images`          | List all stored images   |
| `GET`    | `/api/v1/images/{filename}` | Retrieve a specific image |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/images/{filename}` | Delete a specific image  |

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the project
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```
3. Run the application
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

The application will start on the default port and create the local storage directory at `~/.ijse/eca/storage` if it does not already exist.

## Testing

A Postman collection is available for testing the API endpoints:
